#Background
The Les Paul Rail kit was inspired by a piece of railroad rail found by Les Paul. The artist and his friends took a 2 foot long piece of discarded rail and attached a microphone from a phone and a piece of guitar string along the length of the rail. The rail was able to sustain notes for a large amount of time as Les discovered when experimenting with his contraption. Though the rail was not a practical guitar, it proved a great way to experiment with tuning and notes played on the guitar (The Electric Guitar, 2016).

# Goal
The goal of this project was to create a rail kit for Professor Manzo’s Les Paul: Experiencing Innovation Summer Camp kids to play with. This was accomplished by making a 3D printable rail that allows the camp kids to learn about the timbre by comparing 3D printing filaments to the existing rail, string tuning and tension, how to 3D print using a 3D model, and how 3D printing differs from machining. Our final submission includes this written paper, along with a “rail kit” that includes the 3D printed rail and other components to put the rail together, such as string and tuning mechanisms. We also included step-by-step instructions detailing how to assemble the rail that are easy for young children to read and follow along.

# 3-D	Printed Rail Design
To start, we had to learn more about 3D printing materials and their strengths. Because the rail needed to be able support the tension of tuning a string, we decided that PLA was suitable. We looked into other materials, but others didn’t have as high strength or weren’t easily printable with the resources we had. After looking at the model given to us in gitlab, we realized we needed to scale down the model due to printer constraints. We went with a length of 9 inches. Then we added a bridge and holes for the string to go through. Because the rail has a solid piece in the middle, the model was given two holes on either side of the middle where two strings could be attached. This made it so that the tuners were far enough from the center piece that they would not hit it when tuning. Through testing, including stringing and tuning the instrument, we learned that the holes for the tuners needed to be adjusted, and the holes could be angled so that the string would not vibrate the rail. The final model, as shown below the table of contents, has angled holes through the bridge and holes that fit the exact tuners used.

# The Rail Kit
The kit given to the students should include the following:
1. 3D-Printed Rail (model included in kit; use with any 3D-printer)
2. 2 Tuners from a set of Sperzel All-Long-Post Six-in-line locking guitar tuners with standard buttons (any color) http://www.sperzel.com/ 
3. 2 guitar strings from a set of standard electric guitar strings; 1 and 6 strings from a set of D'Addario XL110 strings used https://www.daddario.com/products/guitar/electric-guitar/xl-nickel/exl110-nickel-wound-regular-light-10-46/
5. Assembly instructions for students 


# Assembly Instructions for Students
The instructions given to the students in the rail kit are as follows:

<b>1.</b> The support material is the thin material on the side of the rail. This can be discarded.Remove the support material from the rail. This can be done using pliers, a flathead screwdriver, or anything on hand.<br>
<b>2a.</b> Remove the top washer from the tuner by twisting it counter-clockwise. <br>
<b>2b.</b> Insert the tuner into the bottom of the holes on the opposite side of the rail with the bridge. <br>
<b>2c.</b> Secure it with the top by inserting it back on the tuner and twisting clockwise. Do this for both tuners.<br>
<b>3.</b> String the rail by placing the strings through the holes on the rail until the ball end of the guitar string rests on the back of the bridge.<br>
<b>4a.</b> Insert the string all the way into the hole in the tuner and twist the string around the metal part. <br>
<b>4b.</b> Twist the knob on the tuner clockwise until the string experiences some tension; this locks the string in place. Do this for both strings.<br>
<b>5.</b> Feel free to use any tuner application to experiment with what notes are being played by either string! Free tuner apps include Pitchlab, Pano Tuner, and Martin Tuner.

# Instructions for Teachers Supervising Printing the 3D Rails
In most cases, you can download the Rail .gcode file from our repository and upload that to your 3D printer software; we used https://www.3dprinteros.com to interface with a LulzBot TAZ 6 printer for the first batch of rails, printing at 10% infill. <br>

Alternately, if you'd like to involve students in the 3D printing process:<br>
<b>1.</b> Upload the Rail .stl file to https://www.3dprinteros.com (or other 3D printer software)
<b>3.</b> Adjust the layout of the model so that it optimally fits within the printer.
<b>4.</b> Once the layout has been finalized, select the <em>Slice</em> button to adjust the slice settings. We found 10% infill and 1mm wall thickness gave a good tradeoff between print resolution, stability, and print time.
<b>5.</b> Finally, once the slice has been created and saved, it can be sent to the printer.

# Other Considerations
Our Rail Kit models can be printed in many different filament colors; for EGIL's Les Paul Music Tech Camp @ WPI, we've used a vaiety of different colors including glow-in-the-dark filament! The 3D-printed Rail can be a useful musical instrument, and allowing students to choose their own color can help them personalize their instrument. Additionally, with some effort, the .stl file we've provided can be modified to allow students to etch their name into one side.
