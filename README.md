# Background
The Les Paul Rail kit was inspired by an experiment Les Paul conducted in his youth, where he and his friends made a simple musical instrument with a discarded piece of rail, a piece of guitar string and some nails, and a microphone made from his mother's telephone. Though the rail was not a practical guitar, it proved a great way to experiment with tuning and notes played on the guitar. 

# Project Goals
The goal of this project was to create a "Rail Kit" for Professor Manzoâ€™s <b>Les Paul: Experiencing Innovation Summer Camp</b> where students could create their own rail-type musical instrument. Our kit contains a 3D printable rail that allows the camp students to learn about the timbre by comparing 3D printing filaments to the existing rail, string tuning and tension, how to 3D-print using a 3D model, and how 3D printing differs from machining. Students assemble the kit themselves and use it in their own music-making! Additional activities in the camp that accompany this one include the creation of a simple pickup and an amplifier. 

# The Rail Kit
Each Rail Kit should include the following components:<br>
<b>1.</b> one 3D-Printed Rail (model included in kit; use with any 3D-printer)<br>
<b>2.</b> two tuners from a set of Sperzel All-Long-Post Six-in-line locking guitar tuners with standard buttons (any color) http://www.sperzel.com/ <br>
<b>3.</b>  two guitar strings from a set of standard electric guitar strings; 1 and 6 strings from a set of D'Addario XL110 strings used https://www.daddario.com/products/guitar/electric-guitar/xl-nickel/exl110-nickel-wound-regular-light-10-46/<br>
<b>4.</b>  one set of Assembly Instructions for Students (below)<br>

# Assembly Instructions for Students
<b>1.</b> Remove any 3D-printed support material from the rail; that is, the thin, flimsy material on the side of the rail. This can be done using pliers, a flathead screwdriver, a file, sandpaper, or anything on hand.<br>
<b>2a.</b> Take a tuner and remove the top washer from it by twisting it counter-clockwise. <br>
<b>2b.</b> Insert the tuner into the bottom of one hole on the opposite side of the rail with the bridge. <br>
<b>2c.</b> Secure the washer with the top of the tuner by inserting it back on the tuner and twisting clockwise. Do this for both tuners.<br>
<b>3.</b> String the rail by placing the strings through the holes on the rail until the ball end of the guitar string rests on the back of the bridge.<br>
<b>4a.</b> Insert the string all the way into the hole in the tuner and twist the string around the metal part. <br>
<b>4b.</b> Twist the knob on the tuner clockwise until the string experiences some tension; this locks the string in place. Do this for both strings.<br>
<b>5.</b> Feel free to use any tuner application to experiment with what notes are being played by either string! Free tuner apps include Pitchlab, Pano Tuner, and Martin Tuner.

# Instructions for Teachers Supervising Printing the 3D Rails
In most cases, you can download the Rail .gcode file from our repository and upload that to your 3D printer software; we used https://www.3dprinteros.com to interface with a LulzBot TAZ 6 printer for the first batch of rails, printing at 10% infill. <br>

Alternately, if you'd like to involve students in the 3D printing process:<br>
<b>1.</b> Upload the Rail .stl file to https://www.3dprinteros.com (or other 3D printer software) <br>
<b>2.</b> Adjust the layout of the model so that it optimally fits within the printer. <br>
<b>3.</b> Once the layout has been finalized, select the <em>Slice</em> button to adjust the slice settings. We found 10% infill and 1mm wall thickness gave a good tradeoff between print resolution, stability, and print time. <br>
<b>4.</b> Finally, once the slice has been created and saved, it can be sent to the printer. <br>

# Other Considerations
Our Rail Kit models can be printed in many different filament colors; for EGIL's Les Paul Music Tech Camp @ WPI, we've used a variety of different colors including glow-in-the-dark filament! The 3D-printed Rail can be a useful musical instrument, and allowing students to choose their own color can help them personalize their instrument. Additionally, with some effort, the .stl file we've provided can be modified to allow students to etch their name into one side. 

# Print Settings
Infill Percentage: 10<br>
Layer Thickness/Height: 0.25mm<br>
Wall Thickness: 0.8mm<br>
Support on build plate (not everywhere)<br><br>
Note: previous versions of this model included lettering on the side, which has been removed since version 1.1
